Space Jam 2 is dumb af. My main issue with Space Jam 2 is how stupid it was that the entire world would be saved by a basketball game... I get it, its a basketball movie so obviously its gonna have basketball but bruh. This AI has the power to literally steal people's souls and bring them into his virtual world and control them basically and he's like "Aight if you win in bball I won't delete you and erase your memory that you won."
